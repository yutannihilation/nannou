//! Items related to wgpu and its integration in nannou!
//!
//! **WebGPU** is the portable graphics specification that nannou targets allowing us to write code
//! that is both fast and allows us to target a wide range of platforms. **wgpu** is the name of
//! the crate we use that implements this specification.
//!
//! This module re-exports the entire `wgpu` crate along with all of its documentation while also
//! adding some additional items that makes `wgpu` easier to use alongside nannou.
//!
//! Useful links:
//!
//! - An awesome [guide for wgpu-rs](https://sotrh.github.io/learn-wgpu/#what-is-wgpu). Highly
//!   recommended reading if you would like to work more closely with the GPU in nannou!
//! - The [wgpu-rs repository](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-rs).
//! - The [WebGPU specification](https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/).
